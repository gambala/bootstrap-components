// We reset this here because previously Normalize had no `figure` margins. This

// iOS "clickable elements" fix for role="button"
//
// Fixes "clickability" issue (and more generally, the firing of events such as focus as well)
// for traditionally non-focusable elements with role="button"
// see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click#Safari_Mobile

// IE10 in Windows (Phone) 8
//
// Support for responsive views via media queries is kind of borked in IE10, for
// Surface/desktop in split view and for Windows Phone 8. This particular fix
// must be accompanied by a snippet of JavaScript to sniff the user agent and
// apply some conditional CSS to *only* the Surface/desktop Windows 8. Look at
// our Getting Started page for more information on this bug.
